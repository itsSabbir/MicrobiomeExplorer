# MicrobiomeExplorer

## Description

`MicrobiomeExplorer` is designed to facilitate the analysis of microbiome data, helping scientists and researchers to gain insights into microbial communities. Through this package, users can process, analyze, and visualize data from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic studies. The goal is to provide a comprehensive toolset that improves upon existing workflows by integrating multiple data types and offering advanced graphical outputs. This package was developed using R 4.1.0 (Platform information) and is intended to be platform-independent, supporting macOS, Windows, and Linux distributions.

## Installation

To install the current version of `MicrobiomeExplorer` from GitHub, use:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("itsSabbir/MicrobiomeExplorer", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(MicrobiomeExplorer)
```

## Overview

Provide the following commands, customized to your R package. Then provide a list of user accessible functions within the package and a brief description of each. Include one image illustrating the overview of the package that shows the inputs and outputs. Ensure the image is deposited in the correct location, as discussed in class. Point the user to vignettes for a tutorial of your package.


## Contributions

Provide a paragraph clearly indicating the name of the author of the package and contributions from the author. Outline contributions from other packages/sources for each function. Outline contributions from generative AI tool(s) for each function. Include how the tools were used and how the results from AI tools were incorporated. Remember your individual contributions to the package are important. E.g.,

The author of the package is Anjali Silva. The author wrote the *InfCriteriaCalculation* function, which calculates the information criteria values given data specifications. Here, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Integrated Complete Likelihood (ICL) are calculated. The *InfCriteriaCalculation* function makes use of map function from `mclust` R package to generate information criteria values. The `stats` R package is used for generating multinomially distributed random number vectors. Part of the code for *InfCriteriaCalculation* function has been taken from `<NamePackage>` R package. (Section of the borrowed code should be clearly indicated and referenced in the InfCriteriaCalculation R script). The *InfCriteriaPlot* is written by the author and generates a plot of information criteria values. The *InfCriteriaPlot* function makes use of the `graphics` R package. *NormFactors* is a function that calculates normalization factors via Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM). *NormFactors* function uses Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) as implemented in `edgeR` R package. No generative AI tools were used in the development of this package.
